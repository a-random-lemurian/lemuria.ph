    Hi, I'm <b>Lemuria</b>. My name is already taken on a lot of other
    websites; if that happens I usually go by <b>a_random_lemurian</b>
    instead. I'm from the Philippines, with an interest in linguistics,
    fictional maps, and so much more.

<p>
Of course I have socials, because then how else would I exist on
the net?

<h3>OpenGeofiction</h3>
<p>
<b>OpenGeofiction</b> is a fictional mapping website that I was most
active in during 2023. I still exist on the website.

<h2>Linguistics</h2>
<p>
I have a major <b>linguistics</b> obsession. I have no degrees (yet).
</p>
<p>
I also made a conlang called <a href="https://github.com/thiguka">Thiguka</a>.
Most documentation of it is on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/conlangs">Conlangs 
Discord Network</a>, but hopefully I'll be able to release more
Thiguka materials onto GitHub.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://conlangs.lemuria.ph">There is a conlangs page.</a>

<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>
Lemuria is the name of a lost continent in the Indian Ocean. I
adopted the name from when I had an interest in it, and it has
since stuck.</p>
<br>
<h3>Other entities named "Lemuria"</h3>
<p>
Any and all organizations that sell "Lemurian seed crystals" are
scammers who engage in gross misuse of my name to spread their
spiritual "holistic" nonsense. Stop it. <s>No, I will not take
    your money as "licensing fees", because I do not wish to
    profit off gullible spiritual people.</s></p>
<p>
I am also <b>not affiliated</b> with a group of two restaurants
named "Lemuria" in BGC and Quezon City. They have been using the
name longer than me, but given that both entities have different
interests (computers and food service respectively), and that
nobody has reached out to me with an inquiry clearly meant for
the restaurant, I should be fine.
</p>
<p>
The Lemuria wordmark, which appears below, is my logo, and should
hopefully distinguish me from all the other <s>impersonators</s>
entities.
