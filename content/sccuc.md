<p>As part of me fantasizing about owning my own datacenter and Internet backbone network, please enjoy
    these maps of the SCCUC backbone.</p>

    Right-click for full-size versions.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: The IPv6 addresses featured in the diagrams may be in actual use. Do not attempt to connect to the SCCUC network as it does not exist and any attempts to reach it will cause unnecessary load. Lemuria did not conduct any WHOIS checks on the IPv6 addresses to be used for the map of the fictional IPv6 backbone before assembling the map and is unwilling to resubnet the whole thing due to having reached the maximum effort threshold.</p>
