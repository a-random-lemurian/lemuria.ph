I'm a cat lover. In a move that's expected to increase the bandwidth load on my server, I have decided to put up some cat photos here, alongside some supplementary information on Ming.

[You can skip the background information and look straight at the photos.](#photos)

## Etymology

Why the cat ended up being named Ming is unknown, as I did not name them. I discovered the cat's name when I was roaming around the neighborhood looking for them, and ended up in a casual conversation with one of the residents, who told me in passing, that the cat was named Ming.

Where "Ming" itself comes from is unknown. Solo_Camping_Girl, a Reddit user, [theorizes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zt194w/comment/j1b4m7b/) that "ming ming sounds like the meows of kittens, same as mew mew is how english voice actions [*sic*] portray meowing kittens."

Barokespinoza23 [states](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/zt194w/comment/j1b5nse/) that a similar-sounding term,  "Mimi" (咪咪), is the generic name for a cat in China. It is an onomatopoeia from the cat's meow, and is also used for calling cats over.

## Ming

Now onto Ming's general features. Ming's gender is unknown. Their fur is primarily white, except for the tail and a small area above their face, on the head, which is black.

I have not seen the cat in many months. They are presumably still alive, but the times that I leave the house may not always align with Ming's general patterns of activity. I also have yet to make initial physical contact with the cat; the cat moved away from me when I attempted to approach them in the past. I might try again, but I would have to be a lot more careful. And thankfully, I now know about extending one's arm out to the cat to allow them to smell it, so I should try that next time.

## Photos

Enough with the etymology, let's get on to what matters most: the cat photos. We do deeply apologize for the bandwidth hog.
