I updated my custom Jekyll theme yet again; major additions include a change to the way posts are listed, some excerpts, and even a photo of Ming at the bottom.

Additionally, there has always been an RSS feed; a link to that was explicitly added. Don't be afraid to use it!

## Next steps

Now my future steps are to perhaps stop repeating myself in my CSS, by defining variables and looking at the "vertical rhythm" thing Minima has in their CSS, which adds the same margin to the bottom of plenty of elements. Right now, the vertical spaces between some elements are slightly inconsistent, making it annoying if you look closely enough.

I'm sure as I keep writing more on this blog and updating the theme as my needs change, I'll learn a thing or two more about CSS.

A quick google search reveals [this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Organizing) from MDN. Some organization is in order too.

Once I've cleaned it up, I ought to open-source the code that makes both this blog and the theme possible.
