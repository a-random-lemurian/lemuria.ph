title: "lemuria.ph Privacy Policy"

This is the privacy policy for Lemuria's personal website, which covers the following domains:

- lemuria.ph
- vps1.lemuria.ph
- conlangs.lemuria.ph

All three websites are both hosted on a virtual private server provided by Ionos.

## Definitions
- Lemuria, we, us: Lemuria, the owner of the website
- You, your, yours: You, the person reading this right now

## What we collect from you
When you make a request to the web server for a page on our website,
we gather technical information such as your:

- IP address, for ensuring that the requested data can be transferred back to you;
- Browser and operating system, because your browser sends it to us, expecting that we have three different versions for Linux, Mac, and Windows (you all get the same HTML, deal with it)</li>
- Your language settings (through the Accept-Language header), because your browser sends it to us (and you will not get a Kenahari-language version by setting that value to “kena” due to the lack of time we have for translating this entire text)</li>

To the best of our knowledge, cookies are not used at all on the three websites, as they are merely static.

However, if we post a link to the website on social media or in a Discord server, we will likely be monitoring the website access logs to see if anyone’s reading it, so that we can fulfill our desire for attention. We might then unconsciously link the IP address data with people who react to the post or reply to it, and deduce that it’s you due to the timestamps of the visits and of the publication of our post being temporally in line.

## What we DO NOT COLLECT
Because there is no functionality on the website that allows user-generated content, there is no way to link personal information such as a legal name, location, or a photo, to a particular site visit or IP address.

## What we do with it
We use the data for multiple reasons:

- Analytics: Who even reads the stuff we put here?
- Security: Can those botnets please stop hammering us in the fruitless search for a non-existent Wordpress admin panel?</li>

## Retention period
The above information is retained until any of: (1) we run out of disk space, (2) forget to make a backup, (3) the universe undergoes heat death, and (4) there are no humans left alive on Earth to maintain the datacenter and it gets reclaimed by nature.

## Third party content
The website may contain links to third-party content or load scripts or images from third-party websites, which have their own privacy
policies. Review those privacy policies for more information.
