To ensure the increased availability of the glorious [soggy cat](https://soggy.cat) ([github repo](https://github.com/ssoggycat/soggy.cat)), made possible by FP, Lauren Fern, and others, soggy.cat's contents have been [mirrored](https://soggy-cat.lemuria.ph) onto lemuria.ph.

The incident in question that compromised the accessibility of the original soggy cat was an expiration in the site's SSL certificates.

Cloudflare had this to say:

> The SSL certificate presented by the server did not pass validation. This could indicate an expired SSL certificate or a certificate that does not include the requested domain name. Please contact your hosting provider to ensure that an up-to-date and valid SSL certificate issued by a Certificate Authority is configured for this domain name on the origin server.

We're sure that Lauren Fern is working on it at this time, but the continued availability of soggy.cat can only be helped by ensuring an increased bus factor.

## Update 2025-05-30
As of 2025-05-30 20:44:33 +08:00, soggy.cat has been restored to normal functionality. The SSL certificate is back! soggy-cat.lemuria.ph will be here to stay, however, as the more websites we have hosting the soggy cat, the more resillient it will be against Fern forgetting to renew her SSL certificates.

This blog is served by the Caddy web server, which automatically handles HTTPS certificates with Let's Encrypt, so I don't have to remember.

## Back matter

Meow!
